# 💼 Linear Regression on 50_Startups Dataset

This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict **Profit** based on startup expenses such as **R&D Spend**, **Administration**, and **Marketing Spend** using the **50_Startups** dataset. It uses `scikit-learn` for model training and evaluation, along with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Load dataset and explore basic statistics
2. Visualize the relationships between variables
3. Preprocess data (drop categorical feature if present)
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`
6. Predict and evaluate using test data
